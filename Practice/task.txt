You have just started a new company. It is time to hire some employees. You will need to create a table that will contain the following information about your new employees:

firstname, last name, title, age, and salary.

After you create the table, you should receive a small form on the screen with the appropriate column names. If you are missing any columns, you need to double check your SQL statement and recreate the table.
