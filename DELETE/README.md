## Deleting rows

When you need to delete data from a table in the database, you can use a DELETE statement, which describes the table to act on, and the rows of the table to delete through the WHERE clause.


Delete statement with condition

``` SQL
DELETE FROM mytable
WHERE condition;

```

If you decide to leave out the WHERE constraint, then all rows are removed, which is a quick and easy way to clear out a table completely (if intentional).
